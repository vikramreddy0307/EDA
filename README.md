# Intoduction
* This is the task given by the company to decode the underlying patterns in the data and explain it to the layman.
# Data
* The data is about the car which has 
   * RPM
   * speed
   * Fuel_economy
   * coolant temp 
   * time factor .
* This data has been collected for every 2 sec when the sensors gets activated which is used by the garage owners to know the performance of the car.

# Exploratory Data analysis
# Method 1: Visualising with respect to RPM
* Part 1:RPM for (Fuel_economy >ideal)
* Part 2: RPM for  (Fuel_economy < ideal)                                                                                                                     
# Method 2:Visualising with respect to Speed
* Part 1:Speed for (Fuel_economy >ideal)
* Part 2: Speed for (Fuel_economy < ideal)
# Drawing conclusions from the above graphs
* Analysing in two conditions:
   *  Speed=0 and RPM ! =0
   * Speed=0 and RPM =0
   * Extra Graphs
